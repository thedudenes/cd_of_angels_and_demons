# Plugin Quick Guide

### What is Yūgen's Terrain Authoring Toolkit?
Yūgen's Terrain Authoring Toolkit is a terrain plugin developed by [Yūgen](https://www.youtube.com/@yugen_seishin) as an alternative to using 3d modelling software like blender to create custom terrain shapes. Instead of having to switch between softwares every time you want to make a change, you can now do it all inside the godot engine itself! This plugin's main functionality is facilitated by the marching squares (not cubes) algorithm. While this plugin was created originally with isometric perspective and 3d pixel art games in mind, it can be used for a plethora of genres.

Below you will find a brief explanation of all the tools included in the plugin. A more in depth explanation of how all the tools function internally can be found in the _documentation+_ folder. Other plugin explanations and where to find certain code can also be found in the same folder.
